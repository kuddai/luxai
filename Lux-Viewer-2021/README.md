# Lux AI Challenge: Season 1 Visualizer

This is the codebase for the Season 1 competition visualizer. The latest version is hosted on https://2021vis.lux-ai.org/. To download a local or past version, check out [the releases](https://github.com/Lux-AI-Challenge/LuxViewer2021/releases/)

To run the visualizer locally, first unzip the release and it should create a folder called dist. Then install the serve package via

```
npm i -g serve
```

Then run

```
serve dist
```

And you should be able to navigate to http://localhost:5000 to use the visualizer, upload replays, and watch them, and begin to analyze matches!

If you would like to view replays in higher quality, add "?scale=2" to the end of the visualizer url. For lower quality you can set as low as "?scale=1". Scale ranges from 1 to 3 with the default being 1.5.

e.g. http://localhost:5000/?scale=2 or https://2021vis.lux-ai.org/?scale=2
